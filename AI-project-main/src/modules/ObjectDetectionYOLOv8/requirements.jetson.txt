# Requirements for Nvidia Jetson (Jetson is linux,Arm64, and has CUDA installed)

# These are installed by the install script prior to Torch / TorchVision being installed in the script
# future
# wheel
# mock
# testresources
# setuptools==58.3.0
# Cython

Pandas                        # Installing Pandas, a data analysis / data manipulation tool
CoreMLTools                   # Installing CoreMLTools, for working with .mlmodel format models
# OpenCV-Python               # Installing OpenCV, the Open source Computer Vision library
Pillow<10.0.0                 # Installing Pillow, a Python Image Library
SciPy                         # Installing SciPy, a library for mathematics, science, and engineering
PyYAML                        # Installing PyYAML, a library for reading configuration files

# Specific versions that match the models we're using. This requires <= Python 3.9. Any
# version higher can use Python 3.10
# Torch==1.10.2                 # Installing Torch, for Tensor computation and Deep neural networks
# TorchVision==0.11.3           # Installing TorchVision, for Computer Vision based AI

# ..except we need to be even more specific: 
# https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/failed-to-load-image-python-extension-could-not-find-module/140278/15
# torch==1.10.0
# torchvision==0.10.0

# We have the ultralytics code itself. No need to install via PIP (Saves a huge amount of PIP pain)
# ultralytics                   # Installing Ultralytics package for object detection in images

# We won't install Torch here at all. It will be done via wheel install in the setup script
# TorchVision                   # Installing TorchVision, for Computer Vision based AI

# We need this, but we don't need this.
